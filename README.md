# My GitHub Actions Playground

This repository is a small sandbox for learning GitHub Actions and Super-Linter.

## What this repo contains

- A Super-Linter workflow under `.github/workflows/`
- Example files used to validate linting and formatting

## How to use

1. Push commits to trigger the workflow.
2. Open the Actions tab to view results.

## Notes

- If a linter fails, check the workflow logs for the file name and rule.
- Some security linters recommend pinning actions to commit SHAs.
